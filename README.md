To use this application, after installing the files. Open 2 terminals to the location of where the files will be installed. In one terminal run the command 
cd client and in the other run the command cd server. Then in both terminals run the command npm install (given that you already have node.js installed, if 
not, install node.js). Then in the server terminal, run the command nodemon index.js (give you have mongodb installed, if not then install mongodb) and then 
in the client terminal run the command npm start. The application should now be running in your default browser.
